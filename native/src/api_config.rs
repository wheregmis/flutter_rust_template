    // vector macro is almost always invoked as vec![..].

    // Here, however, they evaluate to runtime values, which may or may not be optimized out
    // by the compiler. A variety of configurations are demonstrated here which cover most of
    // the modern oeprating systems. Try running the Flutter application on different machines
    // and see if it matches your expected OS.
    //
    // Furthermore, in Rust, the last expression in a function is the return value and does
    // not have the trailing semicolon. This entire if-else chain forms a single expression.
